# Stack Practice Repository

Welcome to the Stack Practice Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of Stack questions that I've practiced to enhance my understanding and proficiency in using Stacks.

## About Stacks

A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push (adding an element to the top) and pop (removing the top element). Stacks are widely used in various applications, including function call management, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms.
